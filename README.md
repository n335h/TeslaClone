# Clone a Page

Choose a website, analyze its design, and try to recreate a clone of its home page using your design and CSS skills.

First, break down the design, and make a plan of how you're going to tackle each part. This includes how you'll plan to organize your CSS. Plan any CSS variables you'll use (for colors, sizes, etc.) - ensure you use at least one! Then create your HTML and CSS files and start creating your clone.
